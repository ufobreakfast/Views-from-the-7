              <p>Spence was born and raised in N. Las Vegas, NV. From the Love of Music and Podcasts
                he came to brilliant idea to start one. His first attempt at being on a mic started
                 with his very first show . Spence is very random and usually comes way out
                  of left field. He will have you experiencing a wide range of emotions from
                   laughing uncontrollably while in the next moment having you angry at the 
                   same time with his randomness.</p>

              <p>Ant was born in Newark, NJ and raised in North Las Vegas, NV. His first experience
                with using a microphone to express himself came at the age of 14 when he was introduced 
                to the music studio. He was a late addition to the Views from the 7 podcast, only added 
                after everyone in the world mutually agreed that Ivan had to go as they couldn't stomach 
                yet another explanation before a trash OSSG! But he will always be remembered
                 for "Damn Kobe, pass the ball!" If at anytime you can't hear Spence it's because Ant talked 
                 right over his ass! Don't follow him, as social media isn't utilized much in his bubble
                  where it's always 80° F and sunny! </p>

              <p class="title">Co Host</p> <hr>
              <p>Passion is Art... I originally had no
                interest in podcasting and didn't know what it was until the first 
                day we recorded. From that day forward I was invested in the brand.
                 Skinny discovered a talent on the audio/visual side of things as 
                 the show’s sound engineer. He is also responsible for the visual 
                 media edits and clips on a weekly basis that the podcast releases.
                  Music is art to me... a dope way to express and create. His drive
                   has grown for podcasting and allowed him to branch into other
                    shows in which he is the host of “Kode Se7en” and Co-Host of
                     “Improvized” under the Views 7 Network.</p>

              <p>With an inherent love for business and all
                the intricacies that come along with it; working behind the scenes of a
                 podcast was the perfect fit for the Las Vegas native Anisha. My passion 
                 for event coordination, networking, paying attention to detail, and the
                  ability to keep calm under pressure  made handling the business side of
                   our show an easy transition. Being an extrovert by nature aka a
                    “social butterfly” is what helped me find my niche in this Podcast World. 
                    The journey from the inception of a podcast to  present day...
                     is truly that...a JOURNEY, so take in every moment of it!</p>
